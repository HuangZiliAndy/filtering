This directory is not part of the interface, or even called internally.
It serves to document how we computed the filter coefficients present in
the file ../filter_utils/filter_function.py, and how we derived
various equations used in the multistreaming code.

See ./notes.txt for some of the math (perhaps not presented very
rigorously or well), and ./main.py for how we computed the filter
shape.

Utilities for resampling and filtering audio data

This repository will contain a Python package containing certain utilities for filtering and
resampling audio data.

The most thing exported, currently, is class Multistreamer which can be used to
split an audio stream into multiple lower-frequency audio streams, each one
representing one frequency band of the input.
